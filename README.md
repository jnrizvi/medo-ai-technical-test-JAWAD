## INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN:
The TypeScript version of the app is available on the 'typscriptify' branch.<br/>
The JavaScript version of the app is available on the 'master' branch.<br/>
Clone this repository, and checkout whichever branch you need. Once cloned, cd into the image-annotator-js folder,<br/>
and run npm install so that the node_modules folder appears. After that, you should be able to enter npm start<br/>
in order to run the app in your browser in port 3000.<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind that I initially wrote the code in JavaScript, then converted it to TypeScript, so in case there are issues<br/>
with running the TypeScript code, please do not hesitate to contact me at jnrizvi@ualberta.ca<br/>
